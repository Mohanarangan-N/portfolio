    <h1>Education</h1>

    <p>
      My educational journey reflects a consistent progression of learning,
      discipline, and intellectual curiosity. From foundational schooling to
      professional engineering education, each stage has played a significant
      role in shaping my academic mindset and technical capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always approached education with a focus on understanding concepts
      deeply rather than memorizing information. This mindset continues to guide
      my academic and professional development.

  <section>
    <h2>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) – Computer Science and Engineering</h2>

    <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Sri Manakular Vinayagar Engineering College</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Puducherry, India</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Currently Pursuing (2nd Year)</p>

    <p>
      I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and
      Engineering, where I am building a strong foundation in core computing
      concepts and modern software technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      The curriculum has provided exposure to both theoretical and practical
      aspects of computer science, including programming, data structures,
      software development principles, and system design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside academic coursework, I actively engage in independent learning
      and project development to strengthen my real-world problem-solving skills.
      This combination of theory and practice has helped me grow as a confident
      and capable learner.

    <h2>Higher Secondary Education</h2>

    <p><strong>School:</strong> Amalorpavam Higher Secondary School</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Puducherry, India</p>

    <p>
      I completed my middle school and higher secondary education at Amalurpom
      Higher Secondary School, where I studied from 5th standard through 12th
      standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      This phase of my education played a crucial role in building discipline,
      consistency, and academic responsibility. It was during this period that
      I developed strong fundamentals in mathematics, science, and logical
      reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>
      My schooling experience here helped me understand the importance of
      structured learning, time management, and perseverance—qualities that
      continue to support my engineering studies today.

    <h2>Primary Education </h2>

    <p><strong>School:</strong> Petit Seminar Higher Secondary School</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Puducherry, India</p>

    <p>
      I completed my early foundational education at Petit Seminar Higher
      Secondary School. This stage laid the groundwork for my academic discipline
      and learning habits.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my primary schooling, I developed essential skills such as reading,
      writing, comprehension, and curiosity-driven learning, which formed the
      base for my future academic growth.

    <h2>Academic Development and Growth</h2>

    <p>
      Each stage of my education has contributed uniquely to my development as
      a learner and problem solver. From foundational schooling to engineering
      education, I have gradually transitioned from structured learning to
      independent exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic journey reflects a steady evolution toward analytical thinking,
      self-learning, and real-world application of knowledge.

  <section>
    <h2>Educational Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      I believe education is most effective when it encourages curiosity,
      critical thinking, and continuous improvement. Rather than focusing solely
      on grades, I prioritize skill development and conceptual clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      This philosophy drives my approach to learning new technologies, building
      projects, and preparing for professional challenges.
