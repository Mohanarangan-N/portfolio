  <!-- ================= ABOUT INTRO ================= -->
  <section>
    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am Mohanarangan, a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate currently
      pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) at C.P. Manakular Vinayagar
      Engineering College, Puducherry. I am presently in my second year of study
      and actively focusing on building strong technical and problem-solving skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I consider myself a highly motivated learner who is deeply interested in
      understanding how technology works at a system level. Rather than limiting
      myself to textbook knowledge, I focus on applying concepts through practical
      projects and real-world use cases.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMIC & TECHNICAL IDENTITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic and Technical Identity</h2>

    <p>
      My academic journey in Computer Science has helped me develop a strong
      foundation in programming, logical reasoning, and structured problem solving.
      I continuously work on strengthening my understanding of core computer
      science concepts while exploring modern technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am particularly interested in areas where intelligence, automation, and
      efficiency intersect. I enjoy building systems that are not only functional
      but also scalable and user-centric.

  <!-- ================= LEARNING PHILOSOPHY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      I strongly believe that true learning happens through implementation.
      Understanding theory is important, but applying concepts in real scenarios
      provides clarity and confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever I learn a new technology or concept, I make it a habit to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Understand the core idea behind the concept</li>
      <li>Explore real-world applications</li>
      <li>Build small implementations or projects</li>
      <li>Analyze limitations and improvement areas</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach has helped me develop a practical mindset and the ability to
      learn independently.
