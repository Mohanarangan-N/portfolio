<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am Mohanarangan, a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with a strong
interest in intelligent systems, automation, and software design.
</p>

<p>
Rather than focusing only on academics, I actively work on projects that help me
understand real-world problem solving, system architecture, and user experience.
</p>

<p>
I believe consistency, discipline, and curiosity are the most important qualities
for a software engineer, and I try to practice them daily.
