  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am Mohanarangan, a passionate and motivated Computer Science and Engineering
    undergraduate currently pursuing my second year of B.Tech at
    <strong>C.P. Manakular Vinayagar Engineering College, Puducherry</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interest in technology goes beyond academics. I enjoy understanding how
    software systems work internally and how intelligent solutions can be built
    to solve real-world problems. I strongly believe in learning through hands-on
    projects, experimentation, and continuous improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence, digital automation,
    and modern web development. I like designing systems that are not only
    technically sound but also user-friendly and scalable.
  </p>

  <p>
    My long-term goal is to become a skilled software engineer who can design,
    develop, and deploy intelligent systems that create meaningful impact.
