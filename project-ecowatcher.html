  <h2>Eco Watcher – Environmental Monitoring Platform</h2>

  <p>
    Eco Watcher is a community-driven environmental monitoring platform
    aimed at raising awareness about pollution and environmental issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform allows users to report pollution incidents and visualize
    environmental data, encouraging responsible behavior and community
    participation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project helped me understand how technology can be used for social
    good, focusing on data representation, system design, and public impact.
