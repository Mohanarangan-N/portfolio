    <h1>Hello, I’m Mohanarangan</h1>
    <h3>Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate</h3>

    <p>
      I am a passionate and self-motivated Computer Science and Engineering student
      currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) at
      C.P. Manakular Vinayagar Engineering College, Puducherry.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am deeply interested in building intelligent software solutions that solve
      real-world problems using Artificial Intelligence, automation, and modern
      web technologies. I strongly believe that technology should be practical,
      scalable, and impactful.

  <!-- ================= ABOUT OVERVIEW ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>

    <p>
      I am currently in my second year of Computer Science and Engineering, focusing
      on strengthening my fundamentals while simultaneously applying my knowledge
      through hands-on projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      My learning approach is practical and curiosity-driven. I prefer understanding
      how systems work internally rather than relying only on theoretical knowledge.
      This mindset has helped me gain clarity in programming, system design, and
      problem-solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      I actively explore areas such as Artificial Intelligence, digital automation,
      workflow optimization, and web application development. I enjoy breaking down
      complex problems into structured solutions and building systems that are
      efficient and user-friendly.
    </p>
