    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <p>
      My projects reflect my interest in solving real-world problems using
      intelligent systems, automation, and modern web technologies. Each project
      is built with a focus on practical usability, logical design, and
      scalability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than creating simple demo applications, I aim to design systems
      that address actual challenges in domains such as retail automation,
      healthcare assistance, and environmental monitoring.
