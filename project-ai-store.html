<!-- ================= PROJECT TITLE ================= -->
<section>
  <h1>AI-Powered In-Store Shopping Assistant</h1>

  <p>
    The AI-Powered In-Store Shopping Assistant is an intelligent retail automation
    project designed to improve the customer shopping experience inside large
    supermarkets. The system focuses on reducing human effort, saving time, and
    enhancing efficiency through artificial intelligence and automation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= ABSTRACT ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Project Abstract</h2>

  <p>
    Modern supermarkets face increasing challenges such as overcrowding,
    inefficient product navigation, long billing queues, and difficulty in
    managing inventory in real time. Customers often struggle to locate items,
    estimate expenses, and complete purchases quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project introduces an AI-powered shopping assistant capable of
    processing grocery lists, validating stock availability, estimating total
    cost, assisting with item collection, and delivering items to a designated
    pickup point. The system aims to automate routine shopping tasks while
    improving accuracy, speed, and overall customer satisfaction.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROBLEM STATEMENT ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

  <p>
    Traditional in-store shopping experiences suffer from multiple inefficiencies:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Customers spend excessive time searching for products</li>
    <li>Manual billing causes long waiting queues</li>
    <li>Stock availability is not transparent to customers</li>
    <li>Employees face difficulty managing large-scale inventory</li>
    <li>Peak hours lead to congestion and poor customer experience</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These issues highlight the need for an intelligent, automated system that
    assists customers throughout the shopping process.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVES ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Project Objectives</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To automate the in-store shopping process using AI</li>
    <li>To provide real-time stock availability and price estimation</li>
    <li>To reduce customer waiting time and manual effort</li>
    <li>To improve inventory tracking and store efficiency</li>
    <li>To enhance the overall retail shopping experience</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= SYSTEM OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>System Overview</h2>

  <p>
    The AI-Powered Store Shopping Assistant operates as an intelligent system
    that interacts with customers, store databases, and automation modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    Customers submit their grocery list through a digital interface. The system
    processes the list, checks item availability, calculates the estimated bill,
    and assists in collecting items efficiently. Once collected, the items are
    delivered to a pickup point for customer collection.
